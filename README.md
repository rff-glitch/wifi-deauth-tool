## Introduction 🛠️

This script automates the process of performing a **deauthentication attack** on a nearby Wi-Fi network using the **Aircrack-ng suite**. It's built to be simple, efficient, and user-friendly, with a few lines of code to handle complex tasks! 😎

---

## Features ✨

- **Automated Deauthentication**: Easily target and disrupt specific Wi-Fi networks with minimal interaction.
- **Network Scanning**: Quickly detect available Wi-Fi networks in range.
- **Intuitive Interface**: With emojis and color-coded output for better user experience! 🌈
- **Built on Aircrack-ng Tools**: Leverage well-known tools like `airmon-ng`, `airodump-ng`, and `aireplay-ng` for maximum compatibility and power.
- **Cross-platform**: Works on Linux systems with proper setup. 🐧

## Installation ⚙️

To get started, make sure you have **Aircrack-ng** installed. If not, use the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt update -y
sudo apt install -y aircrack-ng
```

Once installed, simply run the script:

```bash
bash <script_name>.sh
```

If you encounter issues running the script, try the following:

1. **Run as Admin**: Ensure you have the necessary permissions by using `sudo`:

    ```bash
    sudo bash <script_name>.sh
    ```

2. **Make the script executable**: If you see a "permission denied" error, run:

    ```bash
    chmod +x <script_name>.sh
    ```

This will grant execute permissions to the script, and then you can run it normally:

```bash
./<script_name>.sh
```

---

## Usage 🚀

1. **Launch the script** by executing it in your terminal.
2. **Select your network card** (this is required to start the attack).
3. **Scan for Wi-Fi networks** to find the one you want to target.
4. **Choose the target network** from the list.
5. **Start the deauthentication attack** on the selected network!

You will see output like this:

```bash
💥 Starting the deauth attack on '<SSID>' (<BSSID>) ... Ctrl+C to stop.
```

Use **Ctrl+C** to stop the attack at any time.

## Troubleshooting 🛠️

- **Script Not Running?**
  - Try running the script as an administrator using `sudo`.
  - Ensure the script has execute permissions with `chmod +x <script_name>.sh`.
  
- **Missing Aircrack-ng Tools?**
  - Ensure that **Aircrack-ng** is properly installed by running `airmon-ng`, `airodump-ng`, and `aireplay-ng` individually.
  
- **No Networks Found?**
  - Increase the scan time or check if your Wi-Fi card supports monitoring mode.
